# Docusaurus Preview VSCode Extension

This is a minimal starter extension for Visual Studio Code. The extension registers a single command that shows a `Hello World` notification.

## Development

Install dependencies and compile the TypeScript sources:

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.
